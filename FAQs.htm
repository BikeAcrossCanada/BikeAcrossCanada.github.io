FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)
</H1>
<h3>
<br>
Q: West to East or East to West?
<br>
A: West to East as the mountains will train you.
<br> 
    <br>
Q: How long does it take to travel across Canada? (How many days would the average trip be?)
    <br>
A: The Average duration of trip is about 90 days (including rest days).  It's best to check in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bikeacrosscanada/posts/8434274966641715">Facebook group</a> as others can answer with their own experiences.  You can see on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cTomBXfvQ2kc0OhaNZtP8EmSswP4F_OqlPUb5KOP984/edit?usp=drivesdk&fbclid=IwY2xjawFZTatleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHVpgGbjc8rKuC6FnnPylFOLJQDDD8m0Yl5lmJyecYWIPKgwrbwhhZAU0Zw_aem_PvLmUjSbdJkvQgE9ZYmPXA">spreadsheet</a> tab for Trip Journals as it includes a column for number of days.
<br><br>
Q: What is the average daily distance?
    <br>
A: Approximatly 125km/day, but best to ask in the facebook group for varied experiences.
<br>
<br>
Q: What is the weight of all the gear?
    <br>
A: It depends on personal preference of how much you can handle.  Some prefer light touring, others don't mind the extra weight.  Asking the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bikeacrosscanada/posts/8434274966641715">Facebook group</a> you'll get different answers.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Q: Why not just take the Trans Canada Trail?
<br>
A: Because the Trans Canada Trail is not a national cycling route network.  Please see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SULCgDEQrQa5h3s0-96QHHXooY5Ar2gltczQzF5WyWs/edit?usp=drivesdk"> Google Document</a> for further explanation. 

<br>
    <br>
Q: Why not include the north? Yukon/NWT/NorthernBC/Alberta?
    <br>
A: Because it's not paved, a great distance between services and you really need to be self-reliant.  You can find a great answer from the facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bikeacrosscanada/posts/7662739063795313/?comment_id=7665583576844195">here.</a>
<br>
    <br>
Q: Why isn't the network that's uploaded to Ridewithgps updated?
<br>
A: The project is open-source, you are welcome to volunteer to upload it.   The network is rather large and very detailed.   Every change that's made to the master GPX file, and then Google Maps map for the KMZ file needs to be updated on every track sharing website that the network is on.   This takes a long time to do, and there are no paid staff to-do this.
