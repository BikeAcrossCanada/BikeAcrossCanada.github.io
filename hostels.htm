<H1>Hostels</H1>

<p>Hostels are a great way for the budget minded cyclists to experience the culture of the Canadian Town/city.</p>

There are Backpackers Hostels Canada and Hostelling International Canada as well as Independent Hostels Canada (unaffiliated with the others).

Here's a Google My Maps map for the Independent Hostels Canada and a shared list of these hostels.   Many of which are close to the network.
