  This page will show you step by step instructions for downloading the zip file, unzipping it to a new folder and opening up the contents (KMZ files) with the Organic Maps app, as well as downloading the map areas for offline travel. (The above screenshot shows the 5 layers of the network, the rest of the layers are hidden by default)
</p>
    <br>
  <h1>Step 1: Download the ZIP file</h1>
You can download the <a href="https://archive.org/download/TransCanadaBikeRoute/Trans%20Canada%20Bike%20Route.zip">ZIP file</a> containing the multiple KMZ files, the working GPX file, custom icons and the Excel XLS <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cTomBXfvQ2kc0OhaNZtP8EmSswP4F_OqlPUb5KOP984/edit?usp=drivesdk">spreadsheet</a> file which includes a template for the daily log reporting.
The file is stored on the Internet Archive website <a href="https://archive.org/download/TransCanadaBikeRoute">https://archive.org/download/TransCanadaBikeRoute</a>
<br>
<h1>Step 2: Unzip the files to a new folder</h1>
<p>
Now that the zip file has been downloaded, you need to unzip it into a new folder.
If your device can't unzip zip files directly, you need to install a file manager app. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghisler.android.TotalCommander">Total Commander</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphainventor.filemanager">File Manager</a> are options that have the unzip feature included.
</p>
    <p>
 Create it in the 'Downloads' directory (so it's easy to find).
</p>
    <br>
<h1>Step 3: Download the Organic Maps app to view it.</h1>
<p>
Or you can download it from the app website <a href="https://organicmaps.app/index.html">https://organicmaps.app/</a>
</p>
    <br>
<h1>Step 4: Open the folder from within the Organic Maps app</h1>
<p>
This may take a few actual minutes to load as they are large files.
The 5 layers containing the network are turned on by default. You can see all of the different Layers (Bookmarks) by turning them on (check the checkboxes) one at a time to best see them on the map.
    </p>
<br>
<h1>Step 5: View the data</h1>
    <p>
You can see the samples screenshots of the network shown with the Organic Maps app (tap to enlarge image)
        </p>
<br>
<h1>Step 6: Download map areas</h1>
<p>
You will need to download the map areas across the country where you plan on going. Just zoom in along the network and download the areas as prompted.
</p>
    <p>
It's about 1.1gigs of memory space needed on your device to Download all of Canada, or you can download each province collection or region directly.</p>
